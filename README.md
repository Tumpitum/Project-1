## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand:

1. Any corr between Job Satisfaction and Compensation?
2. For number vars, what's the highest factor correlated with compensation?
3. Find the top indicators for compensation?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  
## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@piyaparn.c/findings-from-project-1-at-udacity-c19728d7448a).
